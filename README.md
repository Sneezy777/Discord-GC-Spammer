# Discord-GC-Spammer
A simple program that was made in a few minutes by an inexperienced programer that can spam Discord Group Chats

So after running the code you are supposed to refocus to your discord group chat that you want to spam, the bot works by changing the name of the gc which in turn pings all of the members

"pyautogui.click(500, 200)" I used mouse coordinates to click on the discord group chats name, you might have to fiddle around and change these coordinates so they are focused on the top left corner where the existing name of the gc is.

As seen by the imports, I used pyautogui, pynput, time, random which you might have to install (pip install ___) 

I doubt that anybody will use this as it is very unconventional and extremely situational. Though I liked the idea of pinging people in a gc through changing the name so hopefully someone cool can take this idea and make it a reality.
